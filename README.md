# ML_ID3
ID3 Algorithm
Machine Learning Algorithms
For this problem, your should use the data in data folder. You should train your trees
on the examples in the training file data/a1a.train and evaluate on the test examples
in data/a1a.test. Remember that you should not look at or use your testing file until
your training is complete.
This is the ID3 algorithm anf the error and depth is calculated.
